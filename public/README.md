# Introduction
I was inspired by Tara Donovan's use of everyday objects to create interesting installations. After browsing images of red solo cups, and seeing many pictures of solo cups strewn out on surfaces, piled ontop of eachother, I became fascinated with the idea of being able to generate such an image without needing to take a photo. The "Chaos" portion of my submission is a tool for generating these collages, each one is unique and scales to fit the browser window. 

The "Symmetry" portion of my submission continues with the theme of utilizing everyday objects, but does so in a more light, fun manner. This tool also scales with the browser, but is symmetrical in the way it repeats for use as a wallpaper or in a similar application. 

## Structure

The majority of the relevant code can be found in the following two files:
